This program will simulate and visualize the MLQ algorithm.


To run & test the program, just download the latest JAR executable.

Make sure you have the latest JDK installed. Nimbus UI may not work with  < JDK 1.6.

the latest build version is always greater than the previous build.
eg. MLFQ-Simulator0.0000b is greater than MLFQ-Simulator0.0000a.

For problems and source code commits, click Issues, then do as you will.

// TODO:

> - Algorithms (MLFQ, FCFS, SJF, RR) ==> actually, e2 nlang. MLFQ will be implemented by me if other algorithms are already done.

please be guided accordingly.



For test cases, look in the Downloads tab for a file named "TestCase"
